The world ended a hundred years ago, but nobody told the machines. You play as 'Scrapped'—human souls uploaded into failing combat shells. Your mission is to reach 'The Core' to restart the world. But every mile you travel, you have to delete a memory of your human life to keep your battery running. By the time you save the world, will there be enough of 'you' left to even care?
